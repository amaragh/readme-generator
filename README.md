# README Generator 

## Description

a high-quality README file is essential to any open source project, and provides significant value to any users and potential contributors. By allowing the project creator to leverage a command-line application to generate a README file for the project, they can work more efficiently, as they can now spend more time on the technical details of the project.

Moving into the second phase of this bootcamp, I am able to apply my newly acquired skills with Node.js to create such a command-line application. This was an interesting challenging in working with asynchronous functions, using Node.js to generate Markdown and then a `.md` file.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)

## Installation

Clone the repo, then from the command line, run `npm install` in the project's root directory to download any dependencies.

## Usage

The demo recording can be found [here](https://youtu.be/5PoZYLOz7u8).



Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
